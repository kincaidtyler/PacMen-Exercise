# PacMen-Exercise
## Description: 
This is a set of code to dynamically add Pacman images to the page while they adhere to borders and flip when borders are hit
## How To Use:
Follow link to the Exercise
Click Add PacMan Button to add a new PacMan to the screen
Click Start Game to begin PacMan's motion around the screen
##Road Map
In the future I would love to have PacMan even more dynamic by looking up and down as well as having a feature that adds another PacMan when one collides with a border
